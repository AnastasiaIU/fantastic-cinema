## Developer Notes
This project intentionally sets the window to be non-resizable to maintain the views' intended size.

The application supports various screen sizes and resolution scaling but may not display views correctly when using enlarged fonts.

If labels appear incorrectly, like in the example below, set your system font size to 100% and retest the app.
